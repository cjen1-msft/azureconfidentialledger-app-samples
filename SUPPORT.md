## How to file issues and get help

This project has been created to educate and accelerate the development of applications targeting the Azure Confidential Ledger (ACL) service. This project does not have a dedicated team of maintainers and as such questions will be responded to on a best efforts basis. No guarantees can be offered as to response times on questions, feature requests, or to the long term road map for the project. Community contributions are welcome.

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.
